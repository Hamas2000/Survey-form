# Afghan Students' Emotional Status Survey 📊

## Survey Description 📝

This survey aims to gather data on the emotional well-being of Afghan students. It is designed to be a valuable tool for understanding the emotional challenges and experiences faced by students, providing insights for both individuals and organizations to better support their mental health.

The survey was inspired by the need for a comprehensive, user-friendly resource to assess and address the emotional needs of Afghan students. Our goal is to create a platform that offers clear questions, practical insights, and easy navigation to fill this gap.

During the development of this survey, we learned the importance of creating an intuitive and informative tool, as well as the value of community collaboration in enhancing such resources.
